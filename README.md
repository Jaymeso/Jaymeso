# 👋 Hi, I'm James Omorogbe

🔐 **Cybersecurity Architect | Zero-Trust Advocate | Cloud Security & Risk Governance**  

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!  
I design and ship zero-trust cloud architectures — IAM, network segmentation, device trust, and DLP across AWS/Azure — then map those controls to NIST CSF, DORA, MiCA, and GDPR.
